This C# program can help recover files of type, jpg, png, pdf, and docx currently <br>
This is if you accidentally delete files or reformat a drive <br>
You need to change line 6 to whatever the beginning of your drive looks like<br>
Example D:, C:, G:, E:, etc.
The choice for chunk_size will be up to you.<br>
The more powerful your system is the higher you could go<br>
I recommend 2 or 3 for best results<br><br>
There is a wiki page link on line 4 with a list of all the hex signatures for different file types<br>
You will need to look up the end signature for those types. <br><br>
I run this code on Visual Studio 2022
